            Honduras is a vibrant Central American country known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and
            warm
            hospitality. It boasts stunning Caribbean beaches, lush rainforests, and ancient Mayan ruins like Copán,
            making it a
            destination full of natural beauty and history. Despite facing social and economic challenges, Honduras is
            home to
            resilient and hardworking people, whose traditions, cuisine, and music reflect a unique blend of indigenous,
            African,
            and Spanish influences.
