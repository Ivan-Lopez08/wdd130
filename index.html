            Hi! My name is Ivan Andres Lopez. I'm from Honduras and deeply passionate about technology and software
            development. I enjoy exploring innovative solutions and continuously learning to improve my skills in this
            ever-evolving field. Over the past few years, I have dedicated myself to expanding my knowledge in areas
            such as
            programming, web development, and data-driven technologies, always seeking new opportunities to grow. I am
            motivated by the
            idea of creating tools and applications that not only solve problems but also make a positive impact on
            people’s lives.
            Beyond coding, I value collaboration, sharing knowledge with others, and staying curious about the latest
            trends shaping
            the future of technology.
        </p>

            Honduras is a vibrant Central American country known for its rich cultural heritage, diverse landscapes, and
            warm
            hospitality. It boasts stunning Caribbean beaches, lush rainforests, and ancient Mayan ruins like Copán,
            making it a
            destination full of natural beauty and history. Despite facing social and economic challenges, Honduras is
            home to
            resilient and hardworking people, whose traditions, cuisine, and music reflect a unique blend of indigenous,
            African,
            and Spanish influences.
